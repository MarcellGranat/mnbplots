# mnbplots

`mnbplots` is a collection of color palettes and themes specifically designed for MNB. The palettes are designed to be accessible and follow the color scheme of the Brand Guidelines.

The package includes a theme for ggplot2, scales for ggplot2, and a few utility functions for working with colors. The package is designed to be easy to use and to make it easy to create standard visualizations across our team.

The package is not on CRAN, so you will have to install it directly from GitHub.
